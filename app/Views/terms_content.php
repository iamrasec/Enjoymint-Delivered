  <h5 class="fw-bold">Binding Arbitration</h5>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Purpose -</strong> Any and all Disputes involving you and Enjoymint Delivered will be resolved through individual arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less discovery and appellate review than in court.  This section (the “Arbitration Provision”) shall be broadly interpreted.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, this section does not apply to an action by either party to enjoin the infringement or misuse of its intellectual property rights, including copyright, trademark, patent and/or trade secret rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Definitions -</strong> The term “Dispute” means any claim or controversy related to the Services or the Software, including but not limited to any and all: (1) Claims for relief and theories of liability whether based on contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statue, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (2) claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement; (3) claims that arise after the expiration or termination of these Terms; (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.  As used in this Arbitration Provision, Enjoymint Delivered means The Fuego Group and any of its predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and “you” means you and any users or beneficiaries of your access to the Services.</li>
    <li><strong>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding / Selection of Arbitrator -</strong> The party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with JAMS, formerly Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, inc. (“JAMS”) by visiting its website (www.jamsadr.com) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-352-5267).  You may deliver any required or desired notice to Enjoymint Delivered.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Sue in Small Claims Court -</strong> Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, either you or Enjoymint Delivered may bring an individual action in a small claims court in the area where you access the Services if the claim is not aggregated with the claim of any other person and if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.</li>
    <li><strong>Arbitration Procedures -</strong> This Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify Enjoymint Delivered about your Dispute. You can obtain the JAMS Rules from the JAMS by visiting its website (www.jamsadr.com) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-352-5267). If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of these Terms, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the JAMS rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If JAMS will not administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written applying the JAMS Rules. A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and Enjoymint Delivered agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in San Jose, CA.   The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator's essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator's award. An arbitrator's award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.</li>
    <li><strong>Waiver of Class Actions and Collective Relief -</strong> THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY'S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</li>
    <li><strong>Arbitration Fees and Costs -</strong> If your claim seeks more than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the JAMS's fees and costs will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If your claims seek less than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the JAMS's fees and costs will be Enjoymint Delivered's responsibility. However, if the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the JAMS's fees and costs shall be governed by the JAMS Rules and you shall reimburse Enjoymint Delivered for all fees and costs that were your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys' fees and additional costs and may only recover your attorneys' fees and costs in the arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is decided in your favor. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, Enjoymint Delivered will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.</li>
    <li><strong>Severability and Waiver of Jury Trial -</strong> If any part of subsection (f) of this Arbitration Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court. WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND ENJOYMINT DELIVERED AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW. If any other clause in this Arbitration Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Provision and the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be given full force and effect.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuation -</strong> This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.</li>
